# libcxx-avr

Generate an Arduino (AVR) compatible libcxx subset from upstream sources.

## Project Status

It worked when I used it last, and it is worthwhile work, but I lack the capacity to maintain this in any reasonable sense.

Please feel free to fork it, build on it, etc. Questions sent to me will be answered on an "as-time-is-available" basis.
